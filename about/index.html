              <br /><br />With the rise in the last 10-15 years of technology
              corporations apparently "striving to build the latest and
              greatest" they missed out on the most important thing.<br /><br /><b
                >The user.</b
              ><br /><br />Tech feels dead inside. There hasn't been any new
              innovation or ideas, it all feels empty. When was the last time
              you saw a piece of software or hardware creation truly break the
              bounds of what was possible? Maybe 5 years? 10? Everyone is
              focused on making the most amount of money with the least amount
              of effort, they forgot the reason why these machines were created
              in the first place. These were just rocks that we somehow
              persuaded into doing complex math and science calculations, but
              now we are wasting hours of our day watching cat videos? Don't get
              me wrong, I find them enjoyable as much as the next guy but we as
              a species are becoming lazy and reliant on technology to do things
              for us in the wrong ways. Big tech is more focused on making
              billions selling your data than they are creating something
              meaningful. That's where we wish to shift the paradigm, and
              instead of making some other useless regurgitated piece of shit we
              strive to bring back innovation and the genuine feeling of being
              inspired. The feeling of looking over at your friend or colleague
              and saying "holy shit we just made that". That feeling is worth
              more than any amount of money. The feeling of creating something
              that matters. <br /><br />- Riley<br />Co-Founder Embedded Labs
